# asteroids
A Clone of Asteroids written as my first Processing app, now ported to p5js.

## JS Porting Notes / To Dos
- port to p5.sounds
- Bug - shots make viewport shift
- report bug with soundFormats() needs to take string|?* to p5.sound
- push to openprocessing
- Fix atrocious hit testing
- Favicon of a ship
- Need better global strategy, so ugly
- setup sparky?

Bug reported on typings.
https://github.com/processing/p5.js/issues/2605
