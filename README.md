# asteroids
A Clone of Asteroids written as my first Processing app, now ported to p5js.

## JS Porting Notes / To Dos
- Bug - shots make viewport shift
- report bug with soundFormats() needs to take string|?* to p5.sound
- push to openprocessing
- Fix atrocious hit testing
- Cleanup/Replace XxxControllers', use [isKeyDown](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/keyIsDown).
- Favicon of a ship
- Need better global strategy, so ugly
- setup sparky?
- Bug reported on typings to p5.js.
